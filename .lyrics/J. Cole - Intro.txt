Yeah
Still at it
Villmatic,
What a life we chose
I'm sending this out to those
Who fell down, but then rose
I'm hot, I'm hell bound with these flows,
Cole,
And when my story's told
Let it be known that I'd never fold
I took my time
I gave my soul
I watched you shine
But me I glow, so
I'm coming for what I'm owed
Ya know

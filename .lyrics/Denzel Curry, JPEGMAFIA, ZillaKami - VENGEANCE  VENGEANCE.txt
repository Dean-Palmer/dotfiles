Who the fuck you think you tryna creep on? (creep on)
Who them niggas in that black Nissan? (Nissan)

Catch a nigga in the bushes doing recon (yeah!)
Cops found a body in the alley (woo!)
Gotta rock the club like a caddie (woo!)
I'ma push your button like an innie (yeah!)
Switch it up and then I head to Cali (aw damn!)
Chop another bitch nigga up (up!)
Put them body parts in the bag (in the bag!)
Put them body parts in the concrete (concrete!)
Spread the concrete across the whole city (whole city)
Plug a nigga up like a dead mitty (uh!)
Voice in my head, got too many (too many)
Hit you with the metal like I'm Yung Simmie (brah!)
I'mma kill everybody how they do 50 (brah!)
Cause I go hard like Timmy! (Timmy!)
Nigga wanna talk about a nigga like Jimmy Neutron
Told you don't mess with the Z-Eltron
Banish my demon, I'm using a seance
Goddamn nigga, wanna talk about you
Put your ass in the ICU, intensive Care Unit
If a nigga keep shootin', bitch! (woo!)

[JPEGMAFIA:]
Uh, made it past twenty-five, I'm set, bitch, let me die
Bet you respect me when I check in with that.45
Slide, ride, this a homicide, pull up to the side, let that man retire
I ain't Drake, this ain't 6ix, issa 9ine, sticky, blicky, iron
Heard you fuck with swine? (Uh-huh)
That ain't my kind
Fuck who you run to
Keep it tucked, you know my chopper shy
When it cries, it cries, if you die, you die
Pussy, meet the sky
Rappers telling lies, ACOG, too hard, write a hit like Akon
Heard you talking shit on Twitter, 40, make 'em log off
Know my presence makes you bitter, bitch, you better be cautious
It's nasty

[ZillaKami:]
Put your black ass in a duffle bag
Slide off in the hopes it's a closed casket
My presence alone can exterminate masses
The tongue speech spells cause blazing rashes
Like who's gonna go and betray the beast?
Like who's gonna go start war with me?
Nigga, who gonna go betray the Zii?
Godzilla, wargod, go start a feast
It's the wardog sup (wassup), fired Sarge in a routine hut (wassup)
In the bottom of hell I clutch (wassup)
Hands covered in blood and rust (wassup)
No nigga can take my soul (wassup)
Drop dead them heads will roll (wassup)
We'll drop the corpse in the cold (wassup)
Wardog I'll stick to the code (wassup)
Now I'm muddy booted, Red Rumin'
Body baggin', head haunted
Police out here, fence jumping
Black metal, gun bustin'
Wardogs bitch, we gon' take up on your fists
We're the Wardogs bitch, where I rake on our wrist (woo!)

Looking in the mirror, the night is gone and I'm waitin'
Such a long, long time to see you
I can't help but smile as I know the colour right
So excited, can't sit still
Gonna catch you in the moonlight
Catch you, in the moonlight
